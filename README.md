## Shoes microservice

Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here.

## Hats microservice

I'll probably begin the microservice by first creating the model and encoder that will contain the Hats data.
Detail model -- Each hat/shoe should have its own fabric, style name, picture_url(pexel), color, location in the wardrobe
List model -- Hats should have name, picture_url
